## üñãÔ∏è What is iA Writer for Mac?

Whether you're a novelist, screenwriter, student, or blogger, iA Writer provides a clean, distraction-free workspace that emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and writing flow.

iA Writer supports:

- **Focus Mode**: Dim surrounding text to highlight the current sentence or paragraph
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Shows adverbs, verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech to improve your writing
- **Seamless File Syncing** via iCloud and Dropbox across Mac, iPhone, iPad
- **Multi-format Export** to PDF, Word, and HTML
- **Custom Templates** for presentations, blogs, and manuscripts
- **Content Blocks**: Include files and images with `{{ }}` syntax for modular writing

With full macOS integration and support for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3), iA Writer is blazingly fast, lightweight, and stable. It‚Äôs a favorite among developers, authors, and anyone who values precision and aesthetics in writing.
